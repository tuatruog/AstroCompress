ROUGH GUIDE:
We use the pythonic names 'append' and 'pop' for encoding and decoding
respectively. The compressed state 'x' is an immutable stack, implemented using
a cons list.

x: the current stack-like state of the encoder/decoder.

precision: the natural numbers are divided into ranges of size 2^precision.

start & freq: start indicates the beginning of the range in [0, 2^precision-1]
that the current symbol is represented by. freq is the length of the range.
freq is chosen such that p(symbol) ~= freq/2^precision.
